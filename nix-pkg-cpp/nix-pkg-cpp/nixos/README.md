# Sample App C++: NixOS Testbed

This folder allows you to test whether building the app from GitHub works without needing to actually change your NixOS system configuration.

## Getting Started
Run this command to build from GitHub:
```bash
nix-build
```
Then, you can run the build program with: 
```bash
./result/bin/sample-app-cpp
```
